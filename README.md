# C-Project-ROOM-ALLOTMENT-
The objective of the project is to deal with the ROOM ALLOTMENT in an easy and efficient manner. Create a strong and secrete database that allows for any connection in a secret way, to prevent any outside or insider attacks.

The basic purpose of designing this project is to get rid from manual entry and record system and try to give easy and simple database management system for ROOM ALLOTMENTS.

This project is designed to keep the record of the rooms in hostel/hotel, allocation of rooms, their monthly rents opr living members and many more things but we are trying to make this management system as much as simple and easy as we  can, but we well try to cover all the basic elements use for Room Allotment management database.

If we talk in simple functionality of this project so our basic target is to keep database of Each N Every ROOMS in hostels/hotels with different angles  such that their room number and can be many more.

As mentioned earlier we will try to make our project easy and simple so it can be implement at any level and can be productive and useful for any hostel/hotel administration.
